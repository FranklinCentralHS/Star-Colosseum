## Reflections

Overall, I was surprised to see that it didn't take me very long to pick up on the program. While I did follow a tutorial (credit:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifXGvlAn0bY), I was able to pretty easily make my own changes to the program (typically making it significantly more complex) alongside adding entirely separate features. There were some things I was able to figure out just from the Godot documentation alone which was insanely surprising to me. Also, even though I knew that I likely wouldn't get much past the basic combat system done, I was surprised by how much I actually got done. Randomizing enemies, refreshing battles, and a main menu were all things I did not expect to actually have time to finish that I managed to fit in. Rest in peace to the shop system, though (unless I finish it in these last couple days; I might). I ended up forgetting to use the branch system for most of the project because I was working by myself (whoops). I definitely would have remembered if I had a partner, but alas, my two braincells do not appear to count. If I were to do this again, I'd definitely like to work with a team. Even if it wasn't working on my concept, I think that the experience is sorely need on my end due to my abysmal social skills. The only reason I didn't do this here is that the only proposal I found interesting was presented by someone who very obviously wanted to work by themselves (all the other proposals seemed really dull in my opinion; I was really looking for someone passionate about their concept which admittedly was a high bar for a bunch of high schoolers given only a week to conceptualize something), and evidentally no one wanted to help with my proposal (not that I care--this game will likely end up as a blueprint for a 3D version as that was my intial vision when I started the first iteration earlier this year). All in all, I'll probably be using this experience in the future as I work on other projects on the side. Hopefully, I can actually be of use as a programmer on my friend's project (that I have done jack diddly squat on).
